# TransektCount
Readme.md

TransektCount is an Android app that supports transect counters in nature preserving projects according to the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme methodology. 
It allows a species-specific counting per transect section. 

The integrated database is organized according to a single transect inspection. That means, a new (prepared and importable) basic database instance will be used per inspection.

Databases can be individually created and adapted regarding meta data, transect sections and expected butterfly species.
The recorded data results (meta data, counts and remarks) may either be read on the smartphone or exported in SQLite- or CSV-format and transferred to a PC for your own processing, e.g. by importing a csv-file into MS Excel.

The app demands for storage access permits which are needed for im-/exporting the counting data, the permit to write settings (to set screen brightness) and the permit to prevent the phone from sleeping (to control the counting screen when used under Android 5.0.1 or newer). 

A detailed description for setting up and using the app as well as sample basic databases (transektcount0.db, transektcount0_Ab01.db and respective English versions) are provided under 'transektcount/docs'.

The apk-file 'transektcount-release.apk' is provided under 'transektcount/apk'. 
It is usable with Android version 4.2.2 or newer (not tested under Android 7.x).

Before using the app, please, read the documentation (provided in German and English).
