TransektCount is an Android App that supports transect counters in nature preserving projects according to the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme methodology. It allows a species-specific counting per transect section. 

The integrated database is organized according to a single transect inspection. That means, a new database instance will be used per inspection.

Databases can be individually created and adapted regarding transect sections and expected butterfly species.
The recorded data (counts and remarks) may either be read on the smartphone or transferred to a PC for your own processing.

The app demands for storage access permits which are needed for im-/exporting the counting data. 

A detailed description for setting up and using the app is provided within the app under menu "Help".
