Installing the App

Download either from F-Droid store,
only app (with future updates from F-Droid store): 

https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.wmstein.transektcount
After installing from F-Droid you should download the docs and a Basic DB from GitHub. 
Docs and Basic DB are downloadable only per link to GitHub:

Or get the app directly from GitHub (most up to date editing status). 
On GitHub the author publishes the complete project with app, source code, docs and prepared Basic DBs:

Project page:   https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount
App, apk-file:  https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/transektcount/apk
Docs and DBs:   https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/transektcount/docs

In any case, before installation you must activate the option "Unknown sources" on your phone under "Settings -> Security".

After download you can install the app by a file or download manager from the download directory.
Copy the Basic DB from download directory to basic directory (/storage/emulated/0).

Important: Thereafter, deactivate the option "Unknown sources"!

Remarks on F-Droid App Store:
Usage of the F-Droid app store is similar safe as Google's Play Store.
Privacy is a concern and all apps are checked and compiled by F-Droid. 
Antifeatures like Ads, tracking or hidden costs will be listet in the app's description.

The apk file (installable app) published under GitHub is functional identic with the one of F-Droid. 
But there is a difference in the compilation key. Therefore an installed apk file from GitHub cannot be updated by an apk file from F-Droid and vice versa. You have to reinstall the app.


Tips

To modify database files of TransektCount you may find the free tool "DB Browser for SQLite" helpful.
It is available among others for Windows and Android. 
For example, you may create new entries or sort or correct existing entries.

Prepared scripts (*.sql) exist for:
 - database transektcount0.db with several sections, sort table "counts" by "SQL TransektCount sort table counts by section_id and code.sql"
 - database transektcount0_Sect01.db with only one section, sort table "counts" by "SQL TransektCount sort table counts 1 section by code.sql"
 - database transektcount0.db, correct misspelling of a name in table "counts" by "SQL Update field name in table counts.sql"
 - database transektcount0.db, substitute a wrong code in table "counts" by "SQL Update field code in table counts.sql"
